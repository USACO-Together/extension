# USACO-Together
A chrome extension to track the progress of your friends on usaco.guide!
What it adds:
- An arrow beside each problem listed in the module you are viewing, and also besides your module progress.
- On hovering over the arrow, you are able to view a list of the progress of the people that you follow, along with the date when the progress was updated.
- Similarly, in the popup, you are also able to check the number of problems that a person you follow has done today and the number of problems that the person has done in total.

Please note that I am not a member of the CP Initiative (the creators of the usaco.guide website) and this is an unofficial extension.
